# Atelier SIGMA Reseau de neurones 

Code to create and train a neural network 

## Why does this git exist ?

Neural Networks are becoming fashionable.<br>
There applications for images studies are multiple.<br>
The goal here is to achieve a Finnish historical map labeling

(Photo Example)

## Who are we ?

Four student from the SIGMA master with a willing of learning about the Neural networks and the DeepLearning

## What does this git do ?

To use this script you will previosly need tensorflow, opencv, and numpy installed. <br>

There is a part that deals with the label extraction
We use images of 30x30 pixels created with a Finnish historical maps and all the label associated.
Then a model is created and some layers are added.
 You also have a vision of the accuracy at the end of the scripts
